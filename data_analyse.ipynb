      "This function takes an `image_patch` object and finds the patch of the object in front of the man. It first finds the patch of the man using `find(\"man\")`. Then, it iterates over a list of object names (`car`, `tree`, `building`, `sign`), and for each object, it finds the patches using `find(object_name)`. It then checks if the vertical center of the object patch is less than that of the man patch, and if so, adds it to the `objects_in_front` list. After iterating over all the objects, it finds the object patch that is closest to the man patch vertically and returns it. If no objects are found, it returns `None`.\n",
